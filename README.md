# HWS Artificial Help Bot


**Notes:**
- Feel free to edit this if you want. Shouldn't be a problem.
- Just please let me know if you make any "bigger" changes on the javascript files.


**Planned features:**
1. Different languages.
2. Adding many more responses.
3. Randomize responses a bit.
4. Maybe? Make a browser extension which will allow you to talk with this tool from HWS Connect.
